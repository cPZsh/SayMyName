I'll try to make SayMyName-development even more open-source:
- commit changes instantly (not only after market-release like before)
- ...? ;)

"old" versions (at the moment published at android market) available at google code:
http://code.google.com/p/roadtoadc/source/browse/#svn/trunk

this is the actual development version that combines "SayMyName" and "SayMyName Dessert"!
